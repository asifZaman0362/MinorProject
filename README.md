# Minor Project
---
This is the source repo of my minor project for my undergraduate degree.
As of right now, I have not the faintest clue what I'm going to make this on.
I just know that it has to be something related to systems because I really want to
do that (always have) but it also has to store data in a database and use web technologies
because thats all the rage these days so whatever. I'm going to list down as many ideas I can
think of below:

**IDEAS**
1. I want to write an assembler (off topic)
2. I want to write a novel (off topic)
3. I want to write a game (also off topic)
4. Automation ?
5. What do you store in a database? Data, duh. But data about what? All sorts of things right?

Stipulations:
We need a database -> We need to store data on a server -> Our program should keep record of things
Be creative dude.
What the fuck even is this readme at this point? Nobody begged you to look at this shit anyway so 
why do even care dude?
Im gonna do this someplace else. peace!
