# Minor Project

Minor project for my undergraduate degree.
This project delivers a secure end-to-end encrypted online mail
exchange service using the [signal protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol).

Furthermore, it also implements an extra layer of security by encrypting the whole message database
using RSA, ensuring the privacy of user messages even if a malicious agent attains full control
of the mail server.
